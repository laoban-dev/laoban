# laoban-admin

The tool laoban is used to manage projects in mono-repos.

In order to make the experience of 'setting up the projects' easier, laoban-admin has been created. In most projects
this will only be used once, to set up the project.

Laoban is used constantly: some users might use it a hundred times a day. It is optimised for this type of usage
pattern. Laoban-admin is not: it is only used very rarely. Thus it is expected that the users are not very familiar with
it.
