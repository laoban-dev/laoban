# Clean up the naming - DONE

Project is about the big thing
packages is about the small thing

so packages.details.json for example
And all the names

And do it soon... then call it 1.0.0

# guards 

## osGuard and pmGuard shouldn't cause error unless guard message
This allows multiple  commands to be given... for example one for windows and one for linux

## guards should be able to be defined 'default true' - done

## Guards should be usable at the command level - done

## guards should be able to compare a value. for example 'color=red' -done

# restruct project so this depends on laoban-admin so that we just install it with `npm i -g laoban`

We still want to keep the two separate I think...
